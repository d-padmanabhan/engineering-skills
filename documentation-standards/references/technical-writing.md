# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a database for our application. Requirements:
- ACID compliance
- JSON support
- Strong ecosystem

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Mature, well-documented
- Strong JSON support with JSONB
- Excellent performance for our use case

### Negative
- Additional operational complexity vs managed options
- Team needs PostgreSQL training

### Neutral
- Need to set up backups and monitoring
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Concise
```markdown
❌ In order to be able to run the application...
✅ To run the application...

❌ It is important to note that the configuration...
✅ The configuration...
```

### Use Active Voice
```markdown
❌ The file is created by the script.
✅ The script creates the file.

❌ An error will be returned if validation fails.
✅ The function returns an error if validation fails.
```

### Use Present Tense
```markdown
❌ The function will return a list of users.
✅ The function returns a list of users.

❌ This command installed the package.
✅ This command installs the package.
```

### Include Examples
```markdown
❌ Use the `fetch` function to make requests.

✅ Use the `fetch` function to make requests:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/users');
const users = await response.json();
```
```

## Code Documentation

### Function Documentation
```python
def calculate_discount(price: float, percentage: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate discounted price.

        price: Original price in dollars.
        percentage: Discount percentage (0-100).
    
    Returns:
        Discounted price.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If percentage is not between 0 and 100.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_discount(100, 20)
        80.0
    """
    if not 0 <= percentage <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Percentage must be between 0 and 100")
    return price * (1 - percentage / 100)
```

### API Documentation
