# Engineering Skills

A collection of Agent Skills for Claude that provide best-practice engineering guidance for code review, generation, and infrastructure management.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality with domain-specific expertise. Each skill packages instructions, workflows, and best practices that Claude uses automatically when relevant to your request.

For more information, see [Anthropic's Agent Skills documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## Installation

### Claude Code

Clone this repository and Claude Code will automatically discover the skills:

```bash
# Clone to your home directory
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/engineering-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/engineering-skills

# Or clone to a project directory
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/engineering-skills.git .claude/skills/engineering-skills
```

Skills in `~/.claude/skills/` are available globally, while skills in `.claude/skills/` are project-specific.

### Claude.ai

1. Go to **Settings > Features**
2. For each skill you want to use:
   - Zip the skill folder (e.g., `python-development/`)
   - Upload the zip file

Note: Claude.ai skills are individual to each user.

### Claude API

Upload skills using the Skills API:

```bash
# Package the skill
zip -r python-development.skill python-development/

# Upload via API (requires skills-2025-10-02 beta header)
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/skills \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02" \
  -F "file=@python-development.skill"
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows the Anthropic Agent Skills specification:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions with YAML frontmatter
└── references/        # Detailed documentation (loaded on-demand)
    ├── topic-1.md
    └── topic-2.md
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens) - Always loaded, used for triggering
2. **SKILL.md body** (<5k tokens) - Loaded when skill triggers
3. **References** (unlimited) - Loaded only when needed

This ensures efficient context usage while providing comprehensive guidance.

## Usage Examples

Once installed, Claude automatically uses relevant skills based on your requests:

- "Review this Python code for security issues" → Triggers `python-development` and `security-testing`
- "Help me set up a Terraform module for AWS" → Triggers `infrastructure-iac` and `cloud-platforms`
- "Create a GitHub Actions workflow" → Triggers `cicd-github-actions`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. Each skill should have a clear, focused purpose
2. Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines
3. Move detailed content to `references/`
4. Include clear trigger conditions in the description
5. Test with Claude before submitting
