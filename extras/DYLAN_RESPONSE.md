# Response to Dylan's Question

```
I started drafting these rules myself back in 2023 and 2024, then expanded them using LLM. These days I don't write rules manually anymore - I just use LLM to generate them. The JavaScript/TypeScript rules, for example, are completely AI-generated.

Common mistakes I've seen: LLMs tend to over-explain obvious stuff, miss edge cases that come up in real code reviews, and sometimes suggest patterns that look good in theory but fall apart in practice. I usually iterate a few times - generate, review against actual code, fix what's missing or wrong, regenerate.

The workflow rules and core standards I wrote myself (beautified by AI) because those are more about process and philosophy. But language-specific stuff? LLM all the way.
